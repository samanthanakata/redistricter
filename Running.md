# Introduction #

I haven't been very good about making it easy to use. It mostly grew in my own development environment and grew just far enough to get it running for my needs to develop the results at http://bdistricting.com/
Someone serious about hacking on it could probably get it running and extend it.

The key scripts to start with are `crawl2010.py` and `runallstates.py`

The --help options on those should be reasonably complete.
